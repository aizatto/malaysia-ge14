# PILLAR 1: REDUCE THE PEOPLEâ€™S BURDEN

Today Malaysians are burdened by a sudden surge in the cost of living. The burden has forced some Malaysians to take up two jobs, such that they do not have time to be with families and friends. Household debt has skyrocketed to the extent that more than 20,000 people under 35 years old have been declared bankrupt.

Students in higher education institutions are saddled with debt as soon as they graduate. Worst, villagers in rural areas and FELDA settlements are also facing a hard time.

All these are destroying the pride of our citizens. We can no longer afford to live in our own country, while corrupt politicians enjoy obscenely lavish lifestyle.

Pakatan Harapan brings forth its commitment with unequivocal commitment and responsibility, to reduce these high cost of living burdens amongst the rakyat through the promises herein.
