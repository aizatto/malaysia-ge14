# PILLAR 2: INSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL REFORM

UMNO and Barisan Nasional has damaged the key institutions of the country such that the level of trust towards them is very low. More people are questioning the integrity of our institutions, especially after several dubious appointments into high-ranking posts.

Cronyism is a cancer in the country. The Crony Capitalism Index published by the international magazine The Economist shamed Malaysia as the second worst in the world after Russia in the year 2016. As a result, even Malay and Bumiputera contractors are feeling the pressure because they are hard-pressed when bidding for government contracts.

Malaysia also fell to position number 62nd in the Corruption Perception Index in 2017, with a decrease of seven points compared to 2016. This is our lowest position since Transparency International (TI) began the Index in 1995. It is the third consecutive year that Malaysia did poorly in the study.

The check and balance mechanism created by our forefathers no longer function effectively, such that sometimes even the Malay Rulers had to step in. That is how bad the centralization of power into Najibâ€™s hands has become.

Pakatan Harapan will restore the confidence in our country's institutions and redeem the dignity of our administration by implementing the following promises.
