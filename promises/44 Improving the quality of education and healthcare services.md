# Promise 44: Improving the quality of education and healthcare services

The people of Sabah and Sarawak have been suffering for decades under BN rule which had failed to provide proper healthcare and educational services.

Teachers and doctors sent to East Malaysia are usually those who are too new to the service. Although they are generally committed and dedicated in their professions, it is a common scenario where will soon re-apply to come back to the Peninsular after gaining necessary experience. This brain drain has reduced the quality of education and healthcare services in Sabah and Sarawak.

Hence, Pakatan Harapan Government will give priority to training local teachers and health workers from Sabah and Sarawak.The new Government if elected will also stop the Barisan Nasional's practice which uses Sabah and Sarawak as the training ground for teachers and young health officials, or as place of "exile" for those who have problems.

On the other hand, if an exchange of staff or officials is to be made, it will be done on a needs basis, including sending excellent officers from Peninsular to a school or health centres requiring their expertise.

The Sabah and Sarawak governments will be given decision making rights in education and health matters. In education, parents will be given the opportunity to decide whether the school will use native language or English.

The curriculum will also have local content so that Sabahan and Sarawakian children can understand their local culture.

Native languages and cultural-related courses will also be offered at public universities in Sabah and Sarawak.All this will be done within the framework of the National Education Philosophy.

In terms of healthcare services, all public hospitals will be equipped with the state of the art technology and equipment to treat more patients, especially those suffering from cardiovascular diseases and cancer.

The drug and medical equipment procurement system will also be made more competitive so that the cheapest price will be paid for high-quality medicines and equipment.

GLCs will be asked to contribute to upgrade healthcare infrastructure, hospital buildings, clinics and education facilities. Special government funds will also be used for this purpose.

Skim Peduli Sihat (Healthcare Insurance Scheme) like the one currently run in Selangor will be introduced in Sabah and Sarawak, with special focus on rural and remote areas.
