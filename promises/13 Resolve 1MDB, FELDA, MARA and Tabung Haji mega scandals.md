# Promise 13: Resolve 1MDB, FELDA, MARA and Tabung Haji mega scandals

Too many misconducts, corruption, malfeasance and leakages have occurred under the administration of Datoâ€™ Sri Najib Tun Razak such that the current UMNO and Barisan Nasional is known as a kleptocratic government, worldwide.

Pakatan Harapan will ensure that everyone involved in corruption will be brought to justice. For that, the Pakatan Harapan Government will carry out a detailed investigation to identify the people who should be made accountable.

We will establish Commissions of Inquiry to investigate, separately, the misdeeds in 1MDB, FELDA, MARA and Tabung Haji. The Commissions will also be tasked to recommend appropriate follow-up actions, as well as detailed mechanisms to resolve these mega scandals.

The governance structure of 1MDB, FELDA, MARA and Tabung Haji will be reviewed to ensure that there is an effective check and balance. We will ensure that holders of key positions must be from professionals and not those with vested political interests.

Dubious overseas investments that have been made by these companies will be stopped and the wealth of this nation will be brought back into Malaysia so that it cannot be stolen by kleptocrats and irresponsible politicians.
