# Promise 20: Make the Malaysian Armed Forces and the Royal Malaysia Police a respected and an enviable force

A modern and capable armed forces and police force is vital to ensure peace in the country and to fight crime. Pakatan Harapan will provide the appropriate financial and infrastructure support to both entities so that they can function effectively.

The financial allocation to the RMP will be increased, in accordance with the need to upgrade the facilities for lower-ranking officers and the need for more officers. The budget for training will also be increased.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will work with both forces to conduct a detailed analysis of their equipment, weaponry and training needs.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will create mechanisms to strengthen relationships and accountability between the police forces and their local communities at state and district levels. Gradual decentralization will be carried out to improve the effectiveness of the police service at the local level.

The Independent Police Complaints and Misconduct Commission (IPCMC) will be established in the first term of the Pakatan Harapan administration. All allegations of misconduct will be investigated in a fair and comprehensive way, including allegations of death in custody.

The role and functions of the policeâ€™s Special Branch will be refined and modernized, so that they can focus on interior security, anti-terrorism, and organized crime. Politically-motivated monitoring will be stopped. The Special Branch will also be given the responsibility to immediately devise a holistic strategy to control and combat religious extremism and terrorism.

To guarantee the welfare of retired military and policemen, the pension rates will be reviewed and adjusted to the current cost of living. For retired policemen, the pension rate before the year 1970 and after year 1970 will be synchronized.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will also finance the associations for former police and military personnel. We will give an initial allocation of at least RM500,000 a year for each association.
