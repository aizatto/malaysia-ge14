# Promise 16: Restore the dignity of the Parliament

Parliament is an important institution to check executive powers. The institution of Parliament must have sufficient infrastructure and funding.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will reintroduce the Parliamentary Services Act 1963, with improvements in certain matters so that the Act is suitable for today’s environment.

The Speaker of the Dewan Rakyat and the President of Dewan Negara will be members whose integrity and credibility are respected by their peers. The Speaker of Dewan Rakyat and President of Dewan Negara must retire from partisan politics as soon as they accept their posts. To ensure that their decisions are fair, a special committee will be formed to receive and examine complaints from members of parliament.

The Leader of the Opposition will be granted the status and provisions equivalent to a Federal Minister.

We will provide funding based on a transparent formula to all members of the Dewan Rakyat so that they can carry out the responsibilities in their respective constituencies and to run their service centers.

To enable Parliament to play its proper role, sittings will take place at a minimum of 100 days per year.

We will institutionalize the Select Committee system in Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara, complete with suitable provisions and appropriate support staff to enable them to function effectively. Temporary Committees can also be created for ad hoc matters.

Key national positions such as appointments to the Human Rights Commission, Election Commission of Malaysia, the Malaysian Anti- Corruption Commission, and Judicial Appointments Commission must be approved by a suitable parliamentary committee. This will reduce the ability of the Prime Minister to intervene in these important appointments.

Important bodies such as the Attorney General’s Chambers, MACC, Bank Negara, the Securities Commission, and the National Audit Department shall be liable to be called by the appropriate parliamentary committee.

The establishment of informal groups in Parliament also will be encouraged to allow exchange of views between members of Parliament. These include groups such as Caucuses and All Party Parliamentary Groups which can also involve representatives of civil society who are not a member of parliament.

The Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee will be reserved for an opposition member of parliament.

To ensure that the people and all stakeholders can be engaged in the policy making process, the Pakatan Harapan Government will start the culture of producing Green Papers so that we can stimulate discussions. We will also produce White Papers to announce major government policies before a new Act is introduced in Parliament.

Every week, 30 minutes will be allocated for Prime Minister’s Questions in the Dewan Rakyat.

The Dewan Negara will be empowered so that it can play the proper role to check and balance the Dewan Rakyat.

We will ensure that the number of Senators appointed by the states is always higher than those appointed by the Federal Government so that the interest of the states are always protected.

In both Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara, specific time will be allocated for:

- Opposition party agenda
- Questions to the Ministers for each Ministry which is mandatory for the respective Ministers or Deputy.
- Debating at Committee level the reports from Human Rights Commission (SUHAKAM), the Auditor General, Public Accounts Committee, and the annual report of Government-Linked Investment companies (GLICS) and Petronas.

To ensure transparency and avoid abuse of power, on an annual basis, the Pakatan Harapan Government will publish the full list of directorships held by Members of Parliament in state-owned enterprises at the federal or state levels, and all private companies, or as a consultant, together with the amount of allowances and other payments they receive.
