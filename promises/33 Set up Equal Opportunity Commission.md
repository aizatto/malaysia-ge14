# Promise 33: Set up Equal Opportunity Commission

One of the pledges in the New Economic Model that was released in 2010 is to establish an Equal Opportunity Commission. The purpose of this Commission is to tackle discriminatory work practices in the public sector as well as the private sector. This policy was intended to increase the competitiveness of our domestic economy. Unfortunately, this proposal was removed from the final version of the New Economic Model, an action criticized even by those who wrote the document.

We recognize that discriminatory practices exist in many economic sectors. Various studies have exposed the discrimination in the private sector. And there are also complaints about injustices in the public sector.

The establishment of an Equal Opportunities Commission, which will be comprised of respected individuals from the private and public sectors, is intended to eliminate the unfair and discriminatory practices. This will create a more diverse workforce that is more resilient, more innovative and more responsive towards market demands and the needs of the country.
