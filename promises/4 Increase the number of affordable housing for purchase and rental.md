# Promise 4: Increase the number of affordable housing for

UMNO and Barisan Nasional has failed to increase the number of affordable housing. They promised to build 1 million affordable houses by 2020 but they have not been able to achieve this. Not even half of it.

Today, too many Malaysians, especially the younger ones, are unable to afford a home. UMNO and Barisan Nasionalâ€™s failure to manage the national housing agenda has resulted in a surplus in the supply of expensive houses worth more than RM500,000 but a severe shortage of houses below RM250,000. We will address this failure and prioritise affordable housing.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will widen the rent-to-own scheme nationally. We will actively look for a consensus and cooperation with commercial banks so that a rent-to-own scheme can be introduced by private developers as well in the secondary market. Under Pakatan Harapan, those who are now renting will be given the chance to migrate to a rent-to- own scheme if they qualify.

One of the main reasons for the high house prices is the difficulty in developing new lands, especially after several giant developers, including some GLCs, who monopolise land to build their private land banks. Worse, they do not build on these lands after acquiring them. They simply hoard the land. As a result, land prices surge, contributing to a surge in property prices. Smaller developers also find it difficult to compete with the giant developers.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will set a time limit within which the companies must complete their constructions so that no corporate giants can hoard land banks without developing them. Incentives will be given to the smaller Bumiputera and non-Bumiputera developers so that they can compete with others on a level field.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will reform the PR1MA programme so that there is no more exploitation by crony developers who obtain government land at discounted prices but then reap high profits by building just a small number of affordable houses.

To increase Bumiputera home-ownership, the Pakatan Harapan Government will encourage and simplify the processes to build affordable houses on lands owned by state Islamic authorities including Waqf land. We will give incentive to encourage Islamic authorities to work with private developers. This will particularly benefit Muslim buyers.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will work with state governments to convert land status if developers want to build affordable houses. The quota for affordable houses will be increased. Tax incentives will be given to companies that focus on affordable housing, especially to encourage them to use the latest cheaper technologies such as the Industrialised Building System (IBS) so that cost to buyers can be reduced.

In order to ensure there is a focused attention at the highest level, a National Affordable Housing Council will be set up to bring together the work of the various agencies under one roof. The Council will be chaired by the Prime Minister. The Council will be tasked, among others, to:

- Build one million affordable houses within two terms of our administration
- Coordinate a unified and open database on affordable housing that are not yet sold, to prevent unscrupulous developers from hiding information
- Coordinate a rent-to-own scheme for the B40 and M40 groups, and to introduce an affordable renting programme for those who qualify, especially from among youths
- Coordinate with the banking sector so that access to housing loans for first housing can be widen
- Take over the maintenance of low cost houses so that burden on dwellers can be reduced
