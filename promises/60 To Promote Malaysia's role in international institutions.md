# Promise 60: To Promote Malaysia's role in international institutions

The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure good governance network, starting with Open Government Partnership which is an international platform on integrity and government transparency.

Since there is a large number of government-owned companies, the new government will engage state-owned firms to be managed by international bodies like in the OECD.

The framework of cooperation between government and civil society based on international standards will also be adapted, particularly those relating to transparency and accountability, such as the Open Contracting Partnership, the Open Budget Initiative, the appropriate standards from the OECD and the World Bank, and others.

We believe that Malaysia can become a leader of developing countries, especially Muslim countries. Efforts will be made to enable a Malaysian to hold the position of the Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), just like Malaysiaâ€™s late Father Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Alhaj has done.

Our role will be reinforced through ASEAN, especially in creating and expediting the formation of an economic community, political and security community, and later ASEAN socio-cultural community of ASEAN.

Key emphasis will be on the creation of an effective economic community, and Malaysia will be more active in regional bodies such as the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA).

Wisma Putra will also contribute in enhancing the capacity of the Malaysian Representative to the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR). This will enable us to play a larger role at the regional level.

The Pakatan Harapan Administration will provide sound policy directions that would empower Wisma Putra to produce talented diplomats who will navigate Malaysia's international engagement effectively. We will be the centre of admiration and respect of the international community.

The Government would also make efforts for Malaysians to be appointed as senior officials at the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta as well as at the Commonwealth Secretariat in London. This will be done during the first term of the Pakatan Harapan Administration.

The Pakatan Harapan Government welcomes the rise of Asia as an emerging power and will pursue a healthy diplomatic and economic relationship by establishing good relations with all countries around the world based on non-aligned principles.

At the same time, the Government will restore Malaysia's status as a non- aligned state and position the country as an influential middle power.

In addition, our nation will be an active partner in ensuring success of international programmes such as Sustainable Development Goal 2030 (SDG2030).
