# Promise 6: Abolish Tolls

Companies that have been given the concessions by UMNO and Barisan Nasional are enjoying high profits. For example, MAJU Holdings had offered to take over the PLUS concession without increasing toll charges for 20 years. If the concession is not profitable, how can MAJU Holdings offer to take over without increasing charges?

But UMNO and Barisan Nasional is allowing these concessionaires, like PLUS, to oppress the people while they reap the profits, even though they are a government linked company. UMNO and Barisan Nasional has no intention to stop the increases in toll charges. In fact, the agreement that they signed had forced billions of taxpayersâ€™ money to be paid as compensation to these selected companies. Even if the toll charges are not increased, these companies continued to reap profits from the lopsided agreements.

Pakatan Harapan believes that the monopoly of these selected concessionaires must be stopped.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will review all highway concession agreements. We will renegotiate to obtain the best value for money for the people so that we can take over the concessions with the ultimate view of abolishing tolls gradually. We believe that infrastructure like roads and highways are the responsibility of the government for the people.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will provide fair compensation to the affected companies.
