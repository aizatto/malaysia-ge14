# Promise 3: Sharing the nation’s wealth in a targeted and equitable way

Our country’s economic growth does not produce equitable benefits to the citizens. The rich are getting richer but the middle and lower classes continue to be under pressure. The increase in median wage level of Malaysians has been too low. The number of people earning below RM2,000 per month is too high. These improprieties must be corrected immediately.

The nation’s wealth is being monopolised by just a few political leaders, their wives and children. They live a lavish lifestyle while the people struggle to cope. The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure our nation’s wealth are shared more equitably by the Bumiputera and every citizen regardless of race and religion, including especially the Indians and the Orang Asal.

The B40 group is already facing a difficult life. But the M40 is facing hurdles too. Both groups will receive targeted help from the Pakatan Harapan Government.

Pakatan Harapan believes that assistance must be given so that no one is left behind. This calls for a mechanism that is more structured, after a comprehensive study of how developed countries do it.

Those who receive BR1M today will continue to receive the grant and the process of payment will be freed from discrimination and partisan politics and more of a statutory payments. The Pakatan Harapan Government will improve the system so that the amount issued are more equitable.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure the giving of assistance is not influenced by party politics and not abused by politicians. The distribution through political parties and through those with vested interest will be stopped because this is unethical. Distribution will be done through government agencies and respected welfare bodies through a statutory payment mechanism.

The targeted welfare programme will function as a universal social safety net for all qualified citizens, just like the system in many developed countries.

At the start, this social security programme will prioritise those with low income living in rural areas, especially in Kedah, Kelantan, and Sabah, as well as FELDA and FELCRA areas. This scheme will be widened across Malaysia gradually.

The implementation of this scheme will require a significant improvement in the database and information kept by the government. The information now stored by the National Registration Department, e-Kasih, Inland Revenue Board, and other agencies, including at state level, will need to be coordinated and updated to ensure accuracy.

Oil and gas-producing states will be given royalty or its appropriate equivalent value. The cruelty of UMNO and Barisan Nasional that have been denying these payments based on political leanings will be stopped immediately.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will increase the royalty payment to Sabah and Sarawak, and other oil producing states, to 20 percent or of its value equivalent, so that the respective states can take over and fund more of their own development activities.
