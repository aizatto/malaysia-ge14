# Promise 55: To increase the space for and diversify the activities of young people

Young people of Malaysia are increasingly active in recreational and non-social activities. This is a positive development as it contributes directly to the creation of inclusive, moderate and positive cultures in our society.

Hence, the Pakatan Harapan Government will support community activities, sports and welfare for young people. We will guarantee freedom for youth activism, as well as promote the growth of youth-led social, welfare and intellectual activities.

State and district libraries as well as community halls will be opened for the wider use of youth. Public spaces such as recreational parks and public sports facilities will be increased. The cooperation of local authorities and state governments will be further strengthened to build and maintain these facilities.

The process for young people to rent stadiums and state-owned sports facilities will be simplified and the costs will be nominal. The Pakatan Harapan Government will encourage the growth of entrepreneurship among young people.

Ministries and relevant agencies will focus on the providing assistance to ensure that young entrepreneurs can succeed in the business of their choice.
