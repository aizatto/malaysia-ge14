# Promise 27: Abolish oppressive laws

Malaysiaâ€™s legal system is frequently abused by the leaders of UMNO and Barisan Nasional to achieve their political interests. Some of these laws were inherited from the British colonial era without amendment to improve weaknesses. There are also tyrannical laws that were enacted by UMNO and Barisan Nasional.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will revoke the following laws:

- Sedition Act 1948
- Prevention of Crime Act 1959
- Universities and University Colleges Act 1971
- Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984
- National Security Council Act 2016
- Mandatory death by hanging in all Acts

The Pakatan Harapan Government will also abolish draconian provisions in the following Acts:

- Penal Code 1997 especially on peaceful assembly and activities harmful to democracy
- Communications and Multimedia Act 1998
- Security Offences (special measures) Act 2012 (SOSMA)
- Peaceful Assembly Act 2012
- Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) 2015

To ensure an effective check and balance, the Pakatan Harapan Government will revoke all clauses that prevent the Court from reviewing decisions of the Government or the laws introduced by the Government.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure that media has the freedom to check and balance our administration. We will review all laws and regulations related to the media so that media freedom is guaranteed. We will also take steps to improve the independence and professionalism of entities such as Radio Television Malaysia (RTM) and BERNAMA.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will also set up a Media Council, comprising its media figures, which will be responsible to develop and implement a code of ethics on reporting and function as a hisbah body for public complaints.
