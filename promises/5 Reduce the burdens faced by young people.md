# Promise 5: Reduce the burdens faced by young people

Young people need help to start their independent lives so that they will be able to fully contribute to the nation quicker. But today young people are under pressure from the surging cost of living, especially if they are at the beginning of their career.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will give priority to young people who qualify to buy or rent affordable houses in Malaysia.

To assist young people in purchasing their first car, the Pakatan Harapan Government will reduce excise duty for imported cars below 1600 cc that are being purchased as the first car so that the price to the buyer is lower.

The burden of PTPTN loans that graduates have to shoulder today will be reduced by extending the date they have to start repayment. These young people will only be asked to start repayment when their monthly salaries reach RM4,000 per month. Students who performed well in their studies and students from low income households will be given commensurate discounts or the loan will be forgiven completely.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will incentivise marriage using mechanisms employed by Pakatan Harapan government in Selangor. This will help young couples under 35 to build their new lives.

Pakatan Harapan believes that good employers will help repay the PTPTN loans of their employees. Thus, tax incentives will be introduced to employers who assist in the repayment without deducting the employee’s salary.

To create more high quality and well-paying jobs that are suited to the qualifications of young people, the Pakatan Harapan Government will spur Malaysia’s economic growth and grow investments by enhancing our integration into the global and regional value chain.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will persuade ASEAN countries to include and quickly and effectively implement graduate mobility into the ASEAN Economic Community agenda. This will enable our graduates to explore job markets in other ASEAN countries.

We will support the growth of the digital and creative economy that are becoming more popular today. We will take the necessary steps to halve the price of broadband internet while doubling its speed.
