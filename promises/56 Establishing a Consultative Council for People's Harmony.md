# Promise 56: Establishing a Consultative Council for People's Harmony

As a first step in positioning Malaysia globally as a moderate country that thrives on inter-racial and inter-religious harmony, the Pakatan Harapan Government will establish National Consultative Council for Harmony. Its roles are to:

a) review and recommend policies and programmes aimed at enhancing unity and integration of the different races and eliminate discrimination from our culture.

b) Review and improve the nation's education system and ensuring early exposure on race relations and religious differences and similarities to students at all levels.

c) Be a platform for brain storming, consultation and reconciliation between the races and religion.

d) Develop new political thinking that is no longer premised on race and religious differences

e) Study and create a mechanism for a new Malaysian society that practices a centripetal-based political model, a system based on middle or moderate principles and rejects extremism.

The government will spearhead efforts to enact National Harmony Act to ensure equality, eliminate discrimination in all respects, and criminalise racial and religious hatred in accordance with the Federal Constitution.

The Council will be further mandated to carry out research and brainstorming to produce recommendations to the Cabinet level for implementation.

The Council will consist of experts in the field of race relations and religious harmony and are respected by all.
