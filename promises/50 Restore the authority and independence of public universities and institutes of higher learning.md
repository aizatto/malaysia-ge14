# Promise 50: Restore the authority and independence of public universities and institutes of higher learning

Higher education complements the nation's education system as part of an effort to achieve an inclusive society.

Pakatan Harapanâ€™s belief is that education must be free, especially in public universities and institutes of higher learning. In addition, these institutions must also have autonomy to carry out their responsibilities.

UNISEL is a perfect example of this, and under our administration in Selangor, it which has begun offering free education in stages, despite having to bear the burden of debt, courtesy of the administration of UMNO and Barisan Nasional.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will abolish Universities and University Colleges Act (1971) and other IPT Acts, and replace them with comprehensive and better laws, to guarantee high quality of education and academic freedom as well as freedom of speech and association. These will be achievable by granting autonomy to these public institutions of higher learning.

Student Unions will be provided allocation by academic institutions, and they will operate independently without government intervention, in accordance with the practice in developed countries.

The Board of Directors (BOD) of the University will be given autonomy and authority to appoint their Vice-Chancellor and Deputy Vice-Chancellors based on their merits and in a transparent and competitive manner.

The BOD will also be empowered to determine performance indicators, evaluating achievement and determining salary ladders and other rewards for senior staff of the university, and managing the financial allocation.

The TVET stream will be widened, beginning with the setting up of German Dual Vocational Training (GDVT) across the country. Through this scheme, companies will be paid for offering industrial training/internship to TVET students.

The UEC Certificate is already recognised for admission to the Bachelor's degree programme at leading universities abroad. Beginning in 2004, UEC certificates have been recognised for entry into private institutions of higher learning in Malaysia. In 2010, UEC certificates have also been accepted for admission to the Bachelor of Education (Chinese) degree programmes at the Malaysian Teachers Education Institute under the Ministry of Education. However, until now, the UEC certificate has not yet been recognised for admission to local public higher education institutions.

Pakatan Harapan will undertake to recognise UEC certificates to enter public institutions of higher learning (IPTA) provided that applicants have a credit in Bahasa Melayu at the SPM level. For this purpose, the UEC certificate will be assessed to be equivalent to the existing general qualification for entry into IPTA.

Pakatan Harapan realises the PTPTN loan has now become a burden to students. We will overhaul the repayment structure of PTPTN loans so that the total repayment will be based on the borrower's salary.

We will undertake to delay the loan repayment for those who earn less than RM4,000 per month and repeal the practice of black listing borrowers who are unable to repay their loans.

Scholarship opportunities and tuition subsidies will be increased, especially to help young children from the B40 and M40 families cover the spiralling cost of living. Government-owned companies will play their role to make this agenda a success.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will increase educational opportunities using recognised and accredited Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC), so young people can use modern technology to continue their studies in their areas of interest.
