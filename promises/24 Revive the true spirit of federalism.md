# Promise 24: Revive the true spirit of federalism

Malaysia is a federal country practicing the concept of federalism. However, this concept has been plundered by UMNO and Barisan Nasional who have heavily centralized powers including from the states.

Pakatan Harapan will revive the true concept of federalism. We have special promises for Sabah and Sarawak, which is as outlined in the next chapter. We will also revive the true spirit of federalism in all other states.

Division of rights and responsibilities as listed in the Ninth Schedule of the Federal Constitution will be respected, and changes to the Ninth Schedule that may increase federal powers will be minimized.

The power of the states will be strengthened by decentralizing suitable jurisdictions, such as the powers to administer public transportation, welfare, social services, agriculture, and environmental protection.

To finance the responsibilities we will return to the states, at least 10 percent of income tax generated in a state will be returned to that state.

In the first three years of our administration, 50 percent on development expenditure will be ring-fenced for the five poorest states, namely Sabah, Sarawak, Kelantan, Terengganu and Perlis.
