# Promise 2: Reduce the pressures causing burdensome price increases

Widespread price increases has become a major burden in the lives of normal Malaysians. In 2017, the inflation rate was 4 percent, compared to just 1 percent in 2015, before the GST was introduced. UMNO and Barisan Nasional leaders are too busy enriching themselves such that they are so detached from the realities of Malaysian lives. They proudly boast their private jets and luxury cars, but the citizens are forced to pay higher prices for daily goods and petrol.

Pakatan Harapan feels the pressures suffered by the people. We will take immediate steps to stabilise the prices of essential items and to control the factors that lead to price increases.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure big companies cannot monopolise the market. The monopolies enjoyed by companies like BERNAS in rice production and distribution, ASTRO in broadcasting, and others, will be re-examined thoroughly. We will also ensure the prices of medicine are fair by enforcing fair competition.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will work proactively with suppliers to ensure that the supply of goods is always sufficient, especially during festivities. Adequate supply that matches demand will help prevent periodic or sudden price surges.

Incentives will be provided so that the supply of daily essential items are ensured and the pressure of price increases will be reduced.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will reduce excise duty on imported cars below 1600 cc for the first car. This will enable the purchase of a first car at a lower price. To avoid abuse, only one car will be allowed for every family with household income below RM8,000 per month.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will abolish highway tolls in stages.

Another factor that contributes to rising prices is the drop in our Ringgit value in the international market. The value of Ringgit has depreciated compared to almost all major world currencies, including Thailand Baht and Bangladeshi Taka! Malaysia imports more than 90 percent of our dairy products, 70 percent of meat, and 50 percent of vegetables. When Ringgit plummets, the prices of these items surge. The Pakatan Harapan Government will give the responsibility to Bank Negara Malaysia to devise a strategy to revive the Ringgit value within 3 years, in a more sustainable way.
