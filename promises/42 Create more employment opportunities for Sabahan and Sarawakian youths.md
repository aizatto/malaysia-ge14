# Promise 42: Create more employment opportunities for Sabahan and Sarawakian youths

The East Malaysian states have not enjoyed equal economic development with the Peninsula. Jobs do not offer adequate income for many. The median salary in Sabah is the lowest in Malaysia, which is 31 percent below the national median salary. Sarawak is the third lowest, 21 percent below the level of national median salary.This is unjust for Sabahans and Sarawakians.

Since 1965, in every election, BN has promised the Pan Borneo Highway but this project has never been completed even though it has been over 40 years since it was first mooted. More unfortunate is their cronies have already begun a move to profit from the promised contracts.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure the connecting highway is built. Up to 30 per cent of the budget allocation for each year will be devoted to Sabah and Sarawak and priority will be the completion of this highway project. Through this provision, the Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure that contracts and good salaried jobs are first offered to locals.

The Pan-Borneo Highway project and projects related to it have the potential to create at least 2,000 jobs for locals. Sabah and Sarawak have local talent and resource that have not been not exploited by Barisan Nasional government. Instead, the ruling regime has a practice of sending officials from the Peninsula aimed at changing the demographics of these two states.

Therefore, Pakatan Harapan Government will give priority to Sabahans and Sarawakians to fill vacancies at every level, especially the upper level in all central and state agencies.

The Borneonization process of the public sector will provide jobs to eligible locals. The new Government will set up an Industrialisation Fund and Entrepreneurs Fund to boost industrialisation and entrepreneurship among the locals.

The tourism sector will be developed so that it contributes to job creation and development funds in addition to promoting the unique cultural, history and natural beauty of the local sites.
