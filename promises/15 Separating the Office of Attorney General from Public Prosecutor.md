# Promise 15: Separating the Office of Attorney General from Public Prosecutor

The Attorney General is the principal legal adviser to the Government and this role should be preserved. But there is an inherent conflict of interest if the Attorney General also serves as the Public Prosecutor because the Government is like a “client” of the Attorney General. It is inappropriate for a lawyer to also hold the ultimate authority to determine whether his client should be prosecuted.

Pakatan Harapan believes that it is best if the position of the Attorney General and Public Prosecutor are separated so that the conflict of interest can be removed. This is in line with the practice in many countries that adopt the Westminster system like Malaysia.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will take immediate steps to separate these two roles.

The Attorney General shall be appointed from amongst the qualified Members of Parliament, and he would become a Minister who can continue the role as chief legal advisor to the Government.

The position of Public Prosecutor will be held by another independent individual who can act without partisan interest. The person will lead Malaysia’s Public Prosecutor Office, enjoying autonomy to exercise his prosecutorial powers.
