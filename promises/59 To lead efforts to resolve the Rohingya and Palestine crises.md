# Promise 59: To lead efforts to resolve the Rohingya and Palestine crises

When faced with the Rohingya and Palestinian crises, UMNO and Barisan Nasional could only watch the situation unfold and have not taken any concrete steps or specific action to ensure the voices of our oppressed brothers and sisters are heard.

In fact, the present government continue to refrain from ratifying the International Convention on Refugees that will enable us to help our brothers more meaningfully.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will address the efforts of regional countries to resolve the Rohingya conflict which has rocked Myanmar to reach an international solution with stronger voices, not merely by organising half-hearted protests for short-term political benefits.

The Pakatan Harapan government will make serious attempts to ensure the Palestinian plight is addressed at the OIC and UN levels to achieve a long- lasting solution to the decades-old crisis.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will also ratify the 1951 International Convention on Refugees so that refugees who escape from war-torn countries and arrive in Malaysia are given proper assistance
