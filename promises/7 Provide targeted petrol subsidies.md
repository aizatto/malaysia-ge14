# Promise 7: Provide targeted petrol subsidies

UMNO and Barisan Nasional abolished petrol subsidy in 2014 and this contributed to a sudden hike in prices which burdens the people. Increase in petrol prices have a significant impact in cost of living, for example, when it comes to the cost of travel to go to work. The worst impact is on the B40 and lower M40 groups.

The sudden removal of petrol subsidies by UMNO and Barisan Nasional without preparing a cushion for those who are worst affected is a cruelty of the highest order. The Pakatan Harapan Government will provide targeted petrol subsidies at a suitable monthly rate to those who qualify. This will be targeted to those who use motorcycle below 125 cc and car below 1300 cc. A quota will be devised to prevent abuse.

Today, there are technologies that will allow our identity cards to be used at petrol pump kiosks. We will devise a mechanism that will enable the targeted subsidy to be allocated using data on the identity cards. This will ensure only those who qualify will be able to access it.

Nevertheless, in giving this targeted subsidy, the Pakatan Harapan Government will always be cognisant of the need to reduce the number of private vehicles on roads to the extent that the environment is not damaged. The Pakatan Harapan Government will remain committed to increasing and improving economically sustainable public transportation so that owning private vehicles no longer become a burdening need of the people.
