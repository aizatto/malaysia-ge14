# Promise 12: Limit the Prime Minister’s term of office and restructure the Prime Minister’s Department

Under the administration of UMNO and Barisan Nasional, Dato’ Sri Najib Tun Razak has monopolized all important powers, and Cabinet Ministers has become nothing but mere yes-men. Pakatan Harapan will reform the role of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister's Department as a whole so that the collective Cabinet administration system can be brought back into Malaysia.

The length of office for the Prime Minister shall be limited to two terms only. This will also be applied to the post of Menteri Besar and Chief Ministers.

The Prime Minister will not simultaneously hold other ministerial posts, especially the post of Minister of Finance.

The number of Minister and Deputy Ministers in the Prime Minister’s Department now is too large. There are 10 Ministers and 3 Deputy Ministers in the Prime Minister’s Department. This raises the question of what role they actually play.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will lower the number of Ministers in the Prime Minister's Department to a maximum of 3 only. Other responsibilities will be passed to the rightful ministries.

The current financial allocation to the Prime Minister’s Department is also too big, allowing the possibility of a wide range of misconduct at the highest level. In the first year of our administration, we will reduce the allocation to the Prime Minister's Department from more than RM17 billion per annum now to less than half, that is RM8 billion only.

The Prime Minister’s Department currently has too many agencies, creating overlaps with agencies in other ministries, and making the Prime Minister like a king. The Pakatan Harapan Government will reduce the number of these agencies by moving them to the relevant Ministries.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will also remove the Prime Minister’s ability to manipulate key institutions by creating stronger check and balance mechanisms. Relevant powers will be decentralized to other bodies, including to the Parliament.
