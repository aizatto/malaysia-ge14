# Promise 9: Improve access to and quality of health services

Equal access to quality health services is an important indicator of a balanced society. But today only those who are better-off have regular access to quality health services. Some public hospitals have sophisticated equipment and committed specialists. But they are hampered by the high number of patients, beyond the capacity they can cater. Among the causes is failure of UMNO and Barisan Nasional to give adequate funding for the healthcare sector. To this day, we are still far from the rate of 7 percent of GDP that is recommended by international bodies.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure that financial allocation for the Ministry of Health is increased to 4 per cent of GDP in the first term our administration. This will ensure the failure of UMNO and the Barisan Nasional which only provides 2 percent of GDP will be addressed immediately.

Pakatan Harapan understands that the people are increasingly concerned about the rising healthcare costs. Many Malaysians still cannot afford to buy health insurance that they require.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will introduce Skim Peduli Sihat, similar to what was implemented in Selangor, to the rest of the country. The scheme provides RM500 per year for B40 families to visit private clinics for basic treatment (primary care). This will ensure they do not depend only to government hospitals or public health centers that may be far from their homes. It also reduces the workload of government health officers.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will also pursue closer collaboration between government health centers with private clinics so that we can enhance service coverage.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will increase budget allocation and will provide incentives for the participation of private companies and charitable bodies to tackle rare diseases, especially among the have-nots, and to help families with special needs children.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will focus on non-communicable diseases. These include prevention and early detection of those diseases, as well as the provision of cancer treatment. This requires coordinated strategies and cooperation of various sectors and levels of society, including urban planning, public transport, and food industry legislation and so on.

More government resources will be channeled to mental health care through government hospitals, especially in terms of human resources and also through insurance coverage.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will also provide compulsory pneumococcal vaccination for all children under the age of 2 years, as is the practice in many other countries.

To ensure proper care of terminally ill patients, we will provide incentives for the establishment of the palliative care centers across the country.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will direct the Ministry of Health to prepare a detailed plan to solve the problems faced by younger doctors or "housemen" who now have to wait for too long. We will review the number of places currently available for the study of medicine so that the number of places as well as the number of scholarships are reflective of the capacity and future needs for medical doctors. Sponsorship to study abroad will be given only to students attending universities that meet the appropriate standards.
