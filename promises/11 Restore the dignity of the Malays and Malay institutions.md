# Promise 11: Restore the dignity of the Malays and Malay institutions

UMNO and Barisan Nasional have been ignoring the advice and the wisdom of the Duli-Duli Yang Maha Mulia Raja-Raja Melayu. They just listen to views that bring them political benefits, and ignore the rest.

The Council of Rulers had commanded that the 1MDB case should resolved quickly. But UMNO and Barisan Nasional simply ignore the commandment. The Council of Rulers had commanded that the country’s check and balance mechanism must be improved. But UMNO and Barisan Nasional continue to manipulate the Royal Malaysian Police, Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, Bank Negara, Attorney General's Chambers and the judiciary, for their political interests. Duli-Duli Tuanku repeatedly reminded the nation that inter-ethnic harmony must be protected. But UMNO and Barisan Nasional allows racial politics to be exploited, including by their leaders.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will always put the views and wisdom of the Duli-Duli Yang Maha Mulia Raja-Raja Melayu in the highest regard, commensurate with the position of the Constitutional Monarchy in our country.

The powers of the Malay Rulers to govern religion and the Malay customs will be returned to the states and interference of the Federal Government will be stopped.

To ensure that Malaysia remains as a harmonious country that retains the special position of the Malays, the Pakatan Harapan Government will establish, on a permanent basis, *Majlis Perundingan Keharmonian Rakyat*, similar to what was once set up by Almarhum Tun Abdul Razak. This will allow the fostering of a better racial and religious relations within the framework of the Federal Constitution.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will encourage public universities to conduct more research and national and international sharing about the Malay Sultanate and civilization so that the history of the Malays can be shared on the world arena.

The Royal Museum at the old National Palace will be upgraded to National Education Museum. Intense cooperation will be created with public universities to enable research activities, publications and education activities through seminars and conferences on a periodic basis, about the institution of the Malay Rulers. Collaboration will also be pursued with the Royal Museums in other countries so that we can share ideas about the important role of the monarchy as a check and balance mechanism in a democratic country.

UMNO and Barisan Nasional has failed to safeguard the Malay reserve land. The Pakatan Harapan Government will protect the Malay reserve land and will ensure that those whose status have been changed will be replaced with land that of similar or higher value.

Suitable government-linked companies will be prepared for management buy-outs so as to increase the percentage of Malay and Bumiputera equity ownership.

The government’s performance and achievements in upholding the Malay and Islamic agenda will be tabled and debated in Parliament each year so that the Government is always accountable to the people as a whole. Malay economic status will be presented in the Budget speech each year so that the Government can be held accountable accordingly.
