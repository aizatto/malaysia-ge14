# Promise 37: Ensuring the long-term prosperity of the rakyat/people

The Government is not the real owner of the state’s wealth. It is only a trustee for its people. Thus, a trustworthy government will never spend the nation's wealth for the sake of short-term gains, ignoring the future needs of the country. It has to be emphasised that such expenditures can lead to an increase in debt.

The UMNO and Barisan Nasional administrations have put the country in a dire situation as a result of extravagance and lavish spending.

Among the Pakatan Harapan Government’s first steps will be to review, list and publish all the BN’s government debts so that the public can access the information.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will also introduce an Act that would prevent the government from dipping into people's trust funds such as Lembaga Tabung Haji (TH), Employees Provident Fund (EPF), Retirement Trust Fund (KWAP) and Armed Forces Fund Board (LTAT) to finance government expenditures.The National Trust Fund Act 1988 will be revamped to enable KWAN (Kumpulan Wang Amanah Negara) to be the state’s financial guarantor, by looking at other success stories such as the Norwegian government’s investment funds. The fixed percentage of profits from Petronas, with a minimum of RM10 billion a year, and the profits of other government-owned companies will be channelled to KWAN, which will function as a long-term national savings fund.

A group that is often forgotten by UMNO and Barisan Nasional is the Chinese living in rural areas and in new villages. Pakatan Harapan is aware of the challenges they face and has their welfare at heart.

New villages and Chinese fishing villages are an important part of Malaysia's historical and cultural landscape. Most of these villages, especially those located in rural areas, suffer from exodus of its young people to the cities due to the lack of economic and employment opportunities there. Today there are more than 600 new settlements in Malaysia, of which over 450 were formed during the emergency period in Malaya.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will provide a fixed allocation of RM 60 million a year (which is three times more than what was allocated by UMNO and Barisan Nasional) in our first term of administration.

Spending will be on infrastructure improvements such as roads, community halls and other public spaces. Funds will also be channelled to help villagers obtain land titles so that they can renovate their property. The main element of this fund is that the community itself will determine how to spend the money.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will also provide low interest lending rate to help small businesses that are the main employment generators in these villages. These loans are expected to attract entrepreneurs who want to invest in in these historical and cultural villages.
