# Promise 26: Make our human rights record respected by the world

The Pakatan Harapan Government will make the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (SUHAKAM) a body that is highly-regarded and respected. SUHAKAM’s Annual Report will be debated in Parliament so that proposals receive the appropriate attention.

The appointment of SUHAKAM Commissioners will be done through a parliamentary committee.

The National Human Rights Blueprint will be improved and implemented in full. Our goal is to ensure Malaysia’s position in the Universal Periodic Review improves and that our performance are at par with global development.

Financial support for the activities of SUHAKAM and other human rights bodies will be improved. The capacity of the Office of the Malaysian Representative to the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) will also be improved so that we can play a major role at the regional level.

Suitable international conventions that are not yet ratified will be ratified as soon as possible, including the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights.
