# Promise 39: Balancing economic growth with environmental protection

Malaysia's development is now taking place without regard to environmental protection and sustainability. The sea is so polluted that it affects the fish habitat. Mining has become an uncontrolled activity until entire areas have become red with dust due to pollution. Logging is licensed without regard to rules and regulation until the catchment areas have become dry which have caused severe flooding. In addition, the dams are built near the rich tropical forests which pose threats various species of animals. UMNO and the current government have ignored the protection of flora and fauna which are extremely important to environmental protection and preservation.

The current government is being dictated by large corporations and their crony capitalists. People's welfare and environmental sustainability are not their main concerns.

The Pakatan Harapan Government promises to govern the country based on principles of sustainability and sustainable development. In short, it will be an environmentally friendly Government.

Additionally, environmental policies and regulations will be regularly reviewed and benchmarked against International Best Practices.All development projects must comply with international environmental protection standards before being granted approval. Approved or ongoing controversial projects will be reviewed to ensure that they comply with established standards.

The logging quota will be enforced strictly so that our forests are conserved.At the same time, the Pakatan Harapan Government will streamline and implement regulations to protect marine life, wildlife and nature, and take punitive action against poachers and illegal loggers.

The Pakatan Harapan Government supports the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The goal of reducing 40 percent carbon emissions by 2020 is one of our key administrative measures. The new Government would also focus on green technology development and renewable energy. The industry has the potential to grow rapidly, creating more job opportunities and ensuring increased returns.

Renewable energy through renewable resources will be increased from the current 2 per cent to 20 per cent by 2025. We will also reduce the dependence on coal power plants which is one of the power generation methods that has a serious impact on CO2 emissions.

The country's investment policy will also be re-evaluated to give priority to high technology industries and to use energy from renewable resources. All laws and regulations pertaining to environmental management and protection will be revised so that proper governance structures can be created, in line with the increasingly demanding modern times.

Strict rules will be enforced to ensure that foreign companies in Malaysia do not contribute to pollution.

We will set up a "National Coordination Council for Climate Adaptation and Mitigation" that will coordinate the actions of the federal, state and local governments to address the challenges of climate change.

The changing climate has led to the extreme weather phenomena which are unpredictable. Towns and seaside towns are now prone to unprecedented flood risks. While there are international efforts to stabilise the climate by reducing carbon emissions, the Pakatan Harapan Government will accelerate adaptation work so that both the infrastructure and the people are ready to deal with the changes that are taking place.

The UMNO and Barisan Nasional’s efforts to build nuclear power plants will be stopped.

The new government will make protection of biodiversity a top priority which will also contribute to the country's sources of income. Our aim is to have at least two more of our country’s National Parks, recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site ("World Heritage Site").
