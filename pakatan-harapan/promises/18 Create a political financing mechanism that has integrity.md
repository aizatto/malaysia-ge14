# Promise 18: Create a political financing mechanism that has integrity

The world was shocked to discover that UMNOâ€™s President Dato Sri Najib Tun Razak, received RM 2.6 billion into his personal account before GE13. Until now, there are still many unanswered questions about the sources of such a huge amount of money. Immediately after the scandal was revealed, UMNO and Barisan Nasional acted as if they want to rectify the situation. But, to this day, no action is taken to regulate political funding so that corruption is not repeated.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure funding of politics in our country is transparent and free from corrupt practices. A new Political Financing Control Act will be introduced for this purpose.

Pakatan Harapan recognizes that various parties have given their views on the mechanisms necessary to ensure that laws relating to political financing are firm and have integrity. In the first year of our administration, Pakatan Harapan will set up a Special Committee to examine again all such proposals. This Committee will be tasked with preparing the Act.

The main principles of the Act will be:

- Political parties that qualify will receive annual funding from the Government according to a formula that is transparent and consistent
- All political contributions must be from sources that can be identified
- Political parties must submit audited financial report every year
- Political parties cannot have assets in excess of RM1 billion
- Government-owned companies are not allowed to make political contributions
