# Promise 17: Ensure transparency and robustness of our election system

We need a free and fair electoral system to ensure the people have trust in our democratic processes. Pakatan Harapan are aware that there are many concerns about the integrity of our electoral system. The Pakatan Harapan Government will take firm actions to restore the trust of the people in our elections.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will free the Election Commission from the grips of the Prime Minister and other politicians by placing the Election Commission fully under Parliamentary monitoring.

A quota will be established to ensure that civil society representatives become members of the Election Commission of Malaysia.

Appointment of members of the Election Commission will be through the process of approval by the Parliament.

A Special Committee will be formed under the Deputy Prime Minister to work with civil society in creating and publishing a guideline for a Caretaker Government. This will be expedited to ensure there is no abuse of government assets in GE15.

The proposals mooted by the Select Committee on Improvements to the Electoral Processes, BERSIH, as well as the GE13 election observation report by the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (IDEAS) will be used as references to improve our electoral system. This includes the need to clean up the electoral roll, improve postal voting, providing a minimum of 21 days for campaign period, provide fair access to the media for all competing parties, and provide accreditation and training early to the independent observers.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will lower the voting age limit to 18 years. Registration will be automatic based on details at the National Registration Department.

To create a healthy competition, the Pakatan Harapan Government will allow all registered parties who are contesting in the election to have air time on TV channels and radio stations run by RTM. We will also ensure RTMâ€™s coverage of the election is fair and just.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure a fair ratio in future delimitation exercises. We will announce transparently to the public the formula being used to determine the number of voters and the size of each constituency.
