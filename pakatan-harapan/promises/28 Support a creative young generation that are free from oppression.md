# Promise 28: Support a creative young generation that are free from oppression

UMNO and Barisan Nasional shamelessly abuse government programs to spread paranoia about narrow ethno-religious politics to influence the youths.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will dissolve the National Civics Bureau (BTN), which over the years actively become a cheap political agent for UMNO.

The National Service Program (PLKN) will be abolished because it is not able to achieve the desired aims and objectives.
Universities and University Colleges Act 1971 will be revoked because it is oftentimes abused to suppress freedom of students.
