# Promise 54: Empowering societal institutions, civil society and social entrepreneurship

Social organisations, civil society and social entrepreneurship are important elements of a modern country. They also have a long history in Islamic and Asian civilisations and play an important role in complementing the role of the government.

Pakatan Harapan is therefore committed to contributing to the growth of these organisations and to be an example to the ASEAN region. We will simplify the process of establishing welfare bodies, foundations and legitimate non-governmental organisations.

Existing bodies, such as associations, limited company guarantees, trustees and others will be reviewed so that a better and simple structure can be created to enable the smooth functioning of these outfits.

Additionally, the Pakatan Harapan Government will also ensure that the process for welfare bodies get tax exemptions is more transparent, easier and free from abuse or interference of political power. For this purpose, a Commission on Charities and Non-Profit Organisations will take over the responsibilities of the Registrar of Societies and Companies Commission of Malaysia.
