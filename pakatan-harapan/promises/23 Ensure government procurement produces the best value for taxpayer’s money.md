# Promise 23: Ensure government procurement produces the best value for taxpayer’s money

The amount spent by the Malaysian Government for public procurement is very large, estimated to be more than RM100 billion a year through various projects and contracts. With such a large amount, it is important to ensure there is no wastage. The government holds taxpayer’s money in trust, and it is the duty of the government to spend the money with prudence.

To ensure that every cent of taxpayer’s money is spent well, the Pakatan Harapan Government will reform the public procurement system and the way contracts are awarded. This is to ensure that it is more competitive and it will generate the best value for taxpayer’s money. We will ensure that the open tendering is used extensively and transparently, particularly for large projects.

Under the Pakatan Harapan Government, the Ministry of Finance will be instructed to review all giant infrastructure projects with foreign countries so that its benefits can be shared by Bumiputera and all Malaysians fairly.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will review the practice of government procurement and tendering system, as well as the processes to issue public- private partnership contracts by the Public-Private Partnership Unit (UKAS). Our aim is to make sure that the criteria for bidding is transparent and consistent.

UKAS currently operates without transparency under the Prime Minister's Department. We will move it to the Ministry of Finance and all procedures to grant contract will be revamped to check the powers of the Minister and to eliminate corruption.

The use of information technology and online systems will be widened so that individual and political influences in decision-making can be eliminated.

Information about contracts that have been awarded will be posted online so that the public and civil society can check them. International best practices such as the relevant OECD guidelines and the Open Contracting Partnership standards will serve as a major reference in our reform.

Small and medium enterprises, including Bumiputera SMEs, will be given help to access information on government tenders, so that they have equal opportunity to bid for suitable contracts.
