# Promise 51: Advance the interests of the disabled

To ensure everyone benefits equally from the development of the country, the disabled as a group must not be side-lined. Under the leadership of the present government, the disabled have been continuously marginalised from the mainstream of development.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will task Institute Social Malaysia to lead to in providing a comprehensive review the current government policy on the disabled. A Centre for Excellence for Persons with Disabilities will be created within the Institute Social Malaysia for this purpose, and to work with all appropriate bodies to achieve the goals of inclusivity.

Allocation for special education in government schools will be increased, especially to train teachers, purchase class equipment, and increase the number of places available for disabled children. The main goal is to create a conducive learning environment for them.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will work with the private sector and social entrepreneurs to provide more technical and vocational training opportunities for the special people. Incentives will also be given to private companies to provide facilities for them, and all government departments and agencies will be required to have a disabled-friendly infrastructure.

The care centres will be placed directly under the wing of a newly established Commission on Charities and Non-Profit Organisations Commission so that they can receive appropriate and timely support.
