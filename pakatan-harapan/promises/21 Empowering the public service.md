# Promise 21: Empowering the public service

The public service is the countryâ€™s backbone in implementing national policies. Developed countries around the world have a respected public service, who work professionally in the interest of the people. Thus, our public servants must be given the appropriate recognition so that they can carry out their responsibilities without fear or favor.

Pakatan Harapan recognizes that our public service sector was once regarded as the best among developing countries and among countries in this region. The Pakatan Harapan Government will put our public service sector back to the rightful place by ensuring that government officials are not influenced by partisan sentiments in the discharge of their responsibilities.

We will limit the interventions local and international consultants in the public sector. We will give our civil service the trust and respect that they deserve because they would know better the best ways to run our government compared to external consultants.

The Public Service Commission will be instructed to identify talented civil servants who have the potentials to play a greater role in the governance of the country and in the states. They will be given the necessary support and training to further develop their talents so that their career progression can be expedited.

Promotions will be undertaken based on service performance and experience. All the processes will be made more transparent so that the civil servants enjoy equal opportunity to obtain a promotion and salary increase.

A creative culture and the ability to think out of the box will be encouraged, so that civil servants can enhance their skills in their respective fields.
