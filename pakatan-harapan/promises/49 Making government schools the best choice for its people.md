# Promise 49: Making government schools the best choice for its people

Good quality education is the key to enabling each of us to move forward to achieve an inclusive and equitable society. The availability of quality schools, such as national, religious or vernacular schools, will enable every child to get a good education to reach its full potential.

Pakatan Harapan believes that ensuring a good schooling system is an important responsibility of the State. Therefore, the profession of teaching and education is a respected profession, and they should be given the necessary support.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure that government assistance is more focused on the needy to achieve B40 and M40 goals. Admission quota to full boarding schools (SBP) and MARA Junior Science College (MRSM) will benefit the low and middle-income groups, especially those from rural areas and FELDA schemes.

The transportation system will be improved, particularly by building better quality of roads in the village and ensuring the safety of school buses. Suitable incentives will be given so more private sectors engage in helping to improve government schools through a joint-venture programme between the government and the private sector (public-private partnership) and through corporate social responsibility (CSR).

We will improve the Trust School programme that is now not running optimally. The UMNOâ€™s Trust School model has led to an increase in the cost of education since additional funds have to be collected from various parties. This is contrary to the general understanding of the concept of Trust Schools which is based on lowering costs instead of raising them.

Therefore, Pakatan Harapan Government will restructure the current Trust School model so that the cost of education as a whole can be reduced by bringing in private sector discipline. Operators who can improve quality without raising costs will be allowed to bid and assist the government in improving the quality of national schools, religious schools, and vernacular schools, especially in rural areas as well as special education schools.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure GLCs increase their number of educational scholarships particularly to the B40 and M40 groups. Special scholarship schemes will also be created for teachers who wish to continue their studies and undergo professional training.

The administrative burden of teachers will be reduced in two ways. First, by creating a Teaching Assistant post to assist teachers, including in executing administrative tasks. Second, by improving access and usability of information technology systems in schools.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will provide National Education Advisory Council with sufficient funds and authority to carry out their duties, in particular to ensure that our Education system stays competitive and in line with the National Education Philosophy.

The Council will also be responsible for overseeing the primary and secondary curriculum, so that it is no longer influenced by political or racial political elements. It will be further empowered to enhance the mastery of Bahasa Melayu, mother tongue and English in schools at all levels, free from political pressures.

Recognising its importance, the Pakatan Harapan Government will develop technical and vocational schools to be at par with other streams so that they are no longer a second option. A full boarding TVET (technical and vocational training) school will be created for outstanding students from all walks of life.

The quality of religious school education, missionary school and national school education will be enhanced by ensuring that the allocation is always sufficient and teachers have the opportunity to undergo professional training periodically. The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure these schools are set up based on public demand and suitability and will have adequate infrastructure
