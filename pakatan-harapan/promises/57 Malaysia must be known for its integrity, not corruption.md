# Promise 57: Malaysia must be known for its integrity, not corruption

The Pakatan Harapan Government is committed to weeding out corruption and ensure offenders are punished appropriately. Our nation must be recognised for its clean image and high integrity based on the international governance indices such as Corruption Perception Index (CPI) and the Global Corruption Barometer (GCB).

We must fight corruption from the top till the bottom. We are committed to making Malaysia among the 10 most-clean countries by 2030 based on Transparency International’s indices.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will provide due diligence to the Malaysian Institute of Integrity to ensure it can fully implement the National Integrity Plan (NIP).

The NIP report will be tabled and debated in Parliament annually. Additionally, the MII will be given a wider mandate to incorporate the principles of integrity in the government administration and thereby projecting Malaysia’s good image in the global arena.

In order to enable the Institute to play its role effectively, the Deputy Prime Minister will assume the role of Chairman of the Board of Directors of IIM.
