# Promise 25: Strengthen the role and powers of the local authorities

The local authority (PBT) including the City Councils are the authorities closest to the citizens. The roles of PBT will be developed further so that the people get the best services more quickly.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure PBTs throughout the country can achieve international service standards in carrying out their responsibilities. Global agenda, such as the Sustainable Development Goals 2030, will be used as the benchmark to improve PBT nationwide.

Pakatan Harapan is committed to strengthen local democracy. The PBTâ€™s accountability to the local community will be improved so that they become more accountable to local people and the local Government Act 1976 will be amended to ensure that this aspiration is realized. Local civil society organizations will be given platforms to express their views directly in the PBT.
