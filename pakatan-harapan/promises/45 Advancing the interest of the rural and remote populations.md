# Promise 45: Advancing the interest of the rural and remote populations

Many Sabahans and Sarawakians still live in villages and the hinterland. Their quality of life is low and they need outside assistance to ensure their lives are protected.

In fact, the poverty they experience has also caused some of them not to register the birth of the child, which has contributed to a rise in stateless children.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will simplify and reduce the bureaucratic red tape involved in registering children.

This goes also for those born in Malaysia but have no legal citizenship rights due to lack of documentation. Pakatan Harapan Government will also resolve problems concerning mistakes in names, addresses and other personal details.

In remote areas and villages, we will pioneer electricity generation initiatives using solar, micro-hydro and biogas.
