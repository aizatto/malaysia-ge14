# Promise 19: Restore public trust in the judicial and legal institutions

The judicial and legal institutions are an important check and balance mechanism in the country. These institutions must be independent and they must have integrity, so that they are trusted by the people. But UMNO and Barisan Nasional continue to plunder public trust in these institutions.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure the appointment of judges are based on merit and experience, regardless of political interest. The power of the Prime Minister to influence the appointment of judges will be removed so that there can be no abuse of power.

Membership of the Judicial Appointments Commission will be decided by a Parliamentary Select Committee. The decision of this Committee will be implemented after referring to the wisdom and discretion of the DYMM Yang DiPertuan Agong and the Rulersâ€™ Council.

We will ensure that the salaries, allowances and remuneration accorded to judges, including judges of the Syariah Court, are commensurate to their professionalism.

The appointment of the Chief Justice and the President of the Court of Appeal through the backdoor as practiced by UMNO and Barisan Nasional will be stopped immediately.

To ensure people fully trust the integrity of decisions made by the courts, a new rule will be introduced so that judges must provide written judgments each time they announce their judgement. If necessary, the judge can issue a brief written judgement first, before the full version is released.
