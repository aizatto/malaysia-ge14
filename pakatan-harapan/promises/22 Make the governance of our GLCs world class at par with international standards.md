# Promise 22: Make the governance of our GLCs world class at par with international standards

Government-linked companies (GLC) play an important role in our economy, both at the national and state level. Some GLCs are governed well, especially those included in the "G20" group, i.e. the group of 20 high- performing GLCs. But, there are still too many weaknesses. The 1MDB and FELDA scandals alone could potentially destroy the good records of the G20 companies. Even more embarrassing is the fact that we donâ€™t even know how many GLCs exist in the country. Yet many of their cronies continue to reap the allowances from holding posts in the GLCs.

The Pakatan Harapan Government subscribes to the tenets of a mixed economy, taking the principles of social market economy as our guidance. GLCs will operate in sectors that suffer from market failure, and not to compete against private companies.

GLCs will be instructed to galvanize the efforts to increase Bumiputera equity holding in the country. We want to see more Bumiputera corporate leaders who are able to continue the cause of our GLCs through management buy-out. The MBO will contribute directly to the increasing Bumiputera equity ownership.

The corporate governance of GLCs at national or state levels will improved so that they can make a bigger contribution to our economic growth.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure the appointment of state and national GLC Board members will be made based on merit and professionalism, not based on politics.

To eliminate conflict of interest, the amount of allowances received by Board members of national and state GLCs will be published annually in a format that can easily be checked by the public.

All GLCs will be required to create a Bumiputera vendor development programs.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will adopt international standards, such as the OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises, to improve the overall governance of our GLCs.

A Parliamentary Committee will be set up to receive regular reports from the Government Investment Division at the Ministry of Finance on the performance of our GLCs.
