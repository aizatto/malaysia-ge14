# Promise 52: Fight crime and social ills

The current government is trying to convince the people that the crime rates in Malaysia have plummeted. However, this claim is untrue as every day one reads disturbing news of increasing crime rates as well as rising number of criminal syndicates.

Pakatan Harapan wants a peaceful and prosperous Malaysia by ensuring law enforcement authorities, especially police, are adequately armed to carry out their duties effectively. This will ensure that peace is maintained, thus enabling us to be a model of peaceful country with low crime rates.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will increase the allocation for the Royal Malaysian Police Force (PDRM) and related enforcement agencies, improve their salaries and quality of life of national heroes as well as increase the number of security personnel.

The PDRM will be adequately funded to enable them to send officers for further training, particularly in efforts to address rising rape and sexual harassment incidents among women and children.

Collaboration between PDRM and other parties involved in dealing with cybercrimes will be enhanced, with appropriate funding and support.

Enforcement agencies will be directed to stop smuggling of alcohol and cigarettes across the border, including tighter controls along the borders and heavier punishments to those convicted.

Strict action will be taken against those who manufacture, sell or engage in cheap supply of alcohol especially to coastal areas, rural areas and selling them to minors.

We will cooperate with private and public sector to carry out anti bullying, anti-crime and anti-social ills campaign in schools, in addition to increasing the number of trained counsellors in schools.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will enhance cooperation with NGOs involved in the rehabilitation of drug abusers to reduce the rate of recidivism.

The new government will also encourage the use of harm reduction measures in addressing the symptoms of drug addiction and reducing illness.
