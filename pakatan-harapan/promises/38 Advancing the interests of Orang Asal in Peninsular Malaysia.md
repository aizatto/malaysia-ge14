# Promise 38: Advancing the interests of Orang Asal in Peninsular Malaysia

For a long time, the Orang Asal of Peninsular Malaysia have been marginalised and treated as lower class by UMNO and Barisan Nasional. This is a tyranny to the native inhabitants of Malaysia.

Hence, Pakatan Harapan wants to recognise, uphold and protect the dignity and rights of this indigenous community.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will overhaul the Orang Asli Development Department (JAKOA) so that the Orang Asli are given the skills and independence to improve their lives and socio-economic conditions rather than being controlled by the department.

We will take the necessary steps in order for the Director General of JAKOA to be from the indigenous community.

Customary land is important matter for indigenous peoples. The Pakatan Harapan Government will work to implement proposals from the National Inquiry Report on Indigenous Land Rights prepared by SUHAKAM in 2013. This report has been ignored by UMNO and BN and will be brought for Parliamentary debate in the first year of the Pakatan Harapanâ€™s administration.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will undertake to ensure that the Orang Asli get better protection in land development schemes such as FELCRA and RISDA. Any unfair deals or agreements concerning the Orang Asli will be revamped.

In order to enable the indigenous customary land to be properly recognised, the Pakatan Harapan Government will allocate funds to carry out a complete study that can accurately identify the boundaries of customary land.

The most important areas such as the cemetery and the land of the Indigenous ancestors will be respected.

More resources will be allocated to upgrade the infrastructure of the Orang Asli villages, including paved roads, 24-hour electricity grid, treated water supply and stable communication networks so that the Orang Asli communities are no longer marginalised.

The number of schools in Orang Asli villages will be increased and equipped with good facility to ensure their children receive quality education. This will include a curriculum that will factor the Sociology of the Origin of Indigenous Peoples. Allocation will also be made to preserve the Indigenous peoples' culture and heritage.

At the same time, relevant programmes will also be implemented to promote the culture and heritage of Orang Asli locally and internationally.
