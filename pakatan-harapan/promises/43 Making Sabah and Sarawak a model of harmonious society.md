# Promise 43: Making Sabah and Sarawak a model of harmonious society

At the time BN leaders were using the tactics of dividing communities based on religion and race to ensure their victory, the people of Sabah and Sarawak could boast of inter-racial and inter religious harmony. In fact, these states are a model of a harmonious multiracial and multi religious society within the framework of Islam as the religion of the Federation as enshrined in the Constitution.

The Pakatan Harapan Government assures the integrity of race relations and religious freedom in Sabah and Sarawak as well as throughout the country. More than that, the Pakatan Harapan Government will promote Sabah and Sarawak as a model of racial harmony so that all Malaysians can emulate the concept of *wasatiyah* that is naturally practised there.

Public universities as well as secondary schools will be given incentives to conduct student exchange activities as well as a study tour of Sabah, Sarawak and the Peninsula to encourage more interaction and mutual recognition of each other.

Additionally, sports activities will also be used to promote _silaturrahim* among Malaysians.
