# Promise 1: Abolish GST

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a tax that oppresses lower income groups. It is a regressive tax that has to be paid even by the poor. It is imposed on us as a result of UMNO and Barisan Nasionalâ€™s failure to manage our economy with required economic and financial prudence. The leakages and corruption of UMNO and Barisan Nasional leaders are now being paid by the citizens through GST.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will abolish the GST within 100 days of coming into power. This will immediately reduce some of the burdens shouldered by the people.

Pakatan Harapan believes that citizens from the lower income group need to be assisted, not oppressed. The abolishment of GST will reduce the cost of living, increase the purchasing power and allow the people to spend their hard-earned money on other priorities.

In the short term, the Pakatan Harapan Government will replace the GST after it has been abolished with a new Sales ad Services Tax that is fairer and does not burden the population and businesses.
