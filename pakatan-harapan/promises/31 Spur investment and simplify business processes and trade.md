# Promise 31: Spur investment and simplify business processes and trade

We will strategize Malaysia’s participation in the regional value and product chains such as in ASEAN, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and other bilateral and multilateral agreements. We will enhance the ability of Bumiputera entrepreneurs and all Malaysian traders to participate in the international market.

Bilateral negotiations with the European Union and other countries will be pursued so that our goods and services can enter new markets, and to attract quality foreign investments.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will encourage continued investment from China and other Asian countries. All mega agreements that have been announced will be reviewed in detail to check against potential weaknesses and corruption. Our goal is to ensure that investments from China are high quality investments that will benefit Malaysians as a whole, especially Bumiputera and other SME contractors of all backgrounds, not just monopolized by those with vested interest. We will also ensure that the projects will not increase our debt level irresponsibly.

Chambers of commerce, business associations and business networks will be given direct access to the relevant ministries and agencies so that they can facilitate meetings between their members with investors and lenders in all sectors.

The Malaysia Productivity Corporation (MPC) will be given the funds and authority to enable them to expand Good Regulatory Practices (GRP) and reduce the burden of unnecessary regulations in all aspects, so that our economy becomes more competitive and we can create more jobs. MPC’s capacity to act as a secretariat for PEMUDAH will be enhanced so that they can become more effective. They will also be given provision to conduct a comprehensive study on the regulatory burden that have been introduced by the UMNO and Barisan Nasional administration that are holding back our economic growth, with a view to remove these burdens.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will encourage the growth of new economy, sharing economy, and research and development. We will strengthen intellectual property protection so that companies can invest more in innovation activities.

Pakatan Harapan believes the next stage of our development can only be achieved if we increase productivity, not just by attracting investments alone. Malaysia's productivity is unsatisfactory as a result of weaknesses in Najib’s administration. Our Total Productivity Factor has been only 1.8 percent on average, compared to circa 2.2 percent in Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will focus on reforming our economic structure so that our productivity improves. Improving our education system and skills training skills, encouraging innovation and the commercialization of intellectual property, helping companies adopting new technologies, automation and the latest IT systems, all will be encouraged in a coherent manner. In addition, the Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure our competition policy framework is the robust, combined with a labor policy that ensures profits are shared fairly. The regulatory framework for SMEs and other businesses will be simplified so that the cost of doing business can be reduced.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will also coordinate our international relations policy with our economic development policy so that Malaysia can use economic diplomacy to help our entrepreneurs succeed regionally and internationally.

Businesses that need help to improve their technology and innovation will be supported, including by way of ensuring our investment policies encourage the entry of new technologies into the country.

Pakatan Harapan believes women can make significant contributions to our economic growth. The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure women can reach the height of their careers without restrictions. We will promote flexible working hours for mothers who need to take care of their children and we will provide incentives to companies that provide support to their female employees.

Pakatan Harapan acknowledges that inability to master English is a weakness in the country. Under UMNO and Barisan Nasional, our students’ performance in the PISA (Program for International Student Assessment) test was unfavorable compared to countries such as Vietnam. The Pakatan Harapan Government will rectify this failure immediately. We will reduce teachers’ administrative burden so that they have more time to teach. We believe investor confidence will improve if we improve the quality of our education.
