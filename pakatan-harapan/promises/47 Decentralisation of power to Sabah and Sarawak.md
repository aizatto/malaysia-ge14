# Promise 47: Decentralisation of power to Sabah and Sa

The Pakatan Harapan Government Pakatan Harapan Government will decentralise the federationâ€™s fiscal administration system in stages so that eventually up to 50 percent of the tax revenue collected in Sabah and Sarawak will be spent on development needs of the latter.

Our Government will also restore state powers to develop its own commerce and trade related policies as Malaysia practices and open economic philosophy in order to benefit from regional and international trade. This includes the recruitment of foreign workers.

The mandate will be given to Sabah and Sarawak to come up with a plan to eliminate trade barriers and all tariffs that have stunted the growth of their economy and prevent the people from leveraging on the openness of our country's economic system.

This includes policies related to public transportation system, cabotage policy, open sky policy and investment policy. The governments of Sabah and Sarawak will regain control over strategic government-owned companies, such as water and electricity companies.

Sabah and Sarawak have unique legal systems and customary courts. The Pakatan Harapan Government will empower this judicial system, starting with establishing an Expert Committee to review the improvements needed for a smooth functioning of Sabah Native Court and the Sarawak Bumiputera Court, as well as to streamline the management of indigenous custom rights.

Customary land ownership rights will be certified and the registration process of ownership rights will be streamlined immediately. The conflict of rights of Indigenous peoples to their land will be settled through the establishment of a Special Land Tribunal that consists of experts in this field.
