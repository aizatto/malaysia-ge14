# Promise 29: Enhance the transparency and integrity of the budget and budgeting process

The country’s annual budget is a mechanism to ensure the government has a coherent and sustainable plan for the country. But UMNO and Barisan Nasional under Dato ' Sri Najib Tun Razak has reduced the budget speech to merely a populist announcement.

UMNO and Barisan Nasional even set up a variety of Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) to hide certain expenditure, preventing the public from knowing the country’s real financial status. Mega projects such as the MRT, LRT Extension, LRT Line 3, ECRL, High-Speed Rail (HSR) and Pan Borneo Highway, are a few examples of hidden expenses using the name of the SPV. When these companies borrow money, their loans are guaranteed by the government. As a result, these contingent liabilities almost tripled, from RM 84 billion in 2009 to more than 200 billion at the beginning of 2018.

UMNO and Barisan Nasional transferred expenditure to build schools and police quarters to GLCs such as Pembinaan BLT and Pembinaan PFI. The large debts incurred by these companies are hidden from the public as they are not mentioned transparently in the budget speech.

All these create a time bomb that can bankrupt the country if not addressed promptly.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will improve the transparency of Malaysia’s financial administration and we will implement a more responsible budget. We will take into account the recommendations of international bodies, such as the International Budget Partnership to improve the process of preparing the national budget.

The Ministry of Finance will be instructed to prepare mid-term reports to enable Members of Parliament to assess the country’s financial performance.

We will implement accrual accounting system so that government expenditure can be better managed.

Since UMNO and Barisan Nasional are hiding too much information from the public, in the first year of our administration, the Pakatan Harapan Government will conduct a comprehensive audit forensics so that we can have full information of the real financial situation of the country. This information will be made public.

To help stakeholder groups play their check and balance role on our administration, the National Statistics Department will be directed to publish important socio-economic data regularly, in a format that is easily analyzed and easily accessible by all. A panel of respected experts will be formed to assure the veracity of the data. All these will help ensure that the public have all the necessary arsenal to make us transparent and accountable.
