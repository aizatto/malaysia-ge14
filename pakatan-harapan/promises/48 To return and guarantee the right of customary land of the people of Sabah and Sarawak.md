# Promise 48: To return and guarantee the right of customary land of the people of Sabah and Sarawak

The ruling government has failed to ensure the protection and legal rights of customary land in Sarawak and Sabah. The peopleâ€™s customary land was sold or leased at very low prices to logging companies and developers of oil palm estates.

To improve their native land rights, Pakatan Harapan Government will implement the recommendations in the National Inquiry Report on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as outlined in the SUHAKAM report.

In the event a customary land has been appropriated, the Pakatan Harapan Government will establish a redress mechanism to ensure the affected party is adequately compensated.

The new Government will enhance the role and functions of Land Department role to properly conduct perimeter studies. Funds will be provided to carry out a complete study which can accurately identify the customary land boundaries.

A Special Land Tribunal will be established immediately to resolve disputes over land rights and boundaries of customary land and settlement of overdue cases.

Development undertaken in the Orang Asli areas must be in accordance with sustainable and environmentally friendly models, taking into account socio-cultural factors of surrounding communities, and it must enlist the active participation of indigenous people.
