# Promise 53: Promote the integrity of family institution and neighbourliness

Family and neighbours are the backbone of civilisation and our nation. Islam and all other religions emphasise on the importance of families and neighbours. However, statistics show that a divorce occurs every 15 minutes in Malaysia.

It is clearly a very disturbing figure, and a reflection of the failure UMNO and Barisan Nasional to uphold the integrity and interest of the family institution.

Pakatan Harapan wants to restore the atmosphere of loving families, and mutual respect between neighbours regardless of their background, race or religion. This is the true culture of the Malay-Islamic and other ethnic groups in the country. We reject the narrow racial politics of the current government and we will strive to create a harmonious multiracial and multi religious society in Malaysia.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will recognise the importance of family via its taxation system. whereby it will provide income tax relief via transferable tax allowance between husband and wife and also introduce income tax relief for married couple.

Additionally, greater attention will be paid on the impact of development on family institutions. We will create high-income employment by boosting economic growth and these opportunities will be available across the country, and not centred on big cities alone. This is to reduce migration away from the family.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will encourage neighbourhood activities and create more space and public parks to facilitate such activities.

Corporate tax exemption will be provided to companies that host activities to contribute to strengthening family institutions.

Activities eligible for tax relief will be determined through consultation with the Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF) and relevant organisations
