# Promise 10: Guarantee people's basic food needs and taking care of the welfare of farmers

Guaranteed food supply is essential to the survival of the people. Adequate stocks of basic food, and the ability to produce the basic food products needed in the country, will ensure that our food supply is secure.

UMNO and Barisan Nasional has focused too much in attracting foreign investors interested only in manufacturing and services, but have forgotten the importance of having a modern and productive agricultural sector. This threatens the security of food supply in the country.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will re-evaluate Malaysiaâ€™s Food Security Policy and create a better policy that makes full use of modern agricultural technology. Farmers will be assisted in accessing new technologies, particularly in the cultivation of rice, vegetables, raw materials, poultry, meat and fisheries.

Our goal is to ensure Malaysia becomes a country that can guarantee self- sufficiency even in times of crisis.

This strategy will also ensure that farmers can improve their household income, and help stabilize the prices of basic necessities because we no longer need to import too many items from overseas.

In the first two years of our administration, we will give emphasis to the country's main staple food namely rice. Pakatan Harapan takes note of the demands from Badan Bertindak Selamatkan Industri Padi Beras Negara and we promise to help paddy farmers nationwide with the aim of making the rice industry more productive and ensure the welfare of paddy farmers.

The monopoly granted by UMNO and Barisan Nasional to BERNAS will be removed and our Government will ensure that there is supervision at every stage of rice production.

The goal of our Government is to ensure that the maximization of the country's rice supply and that our stocks will give priority to local rice.

To guarantee the welfare of farmers, the Pakatan Harapan Government will control the influx of imported rice and take stern actions against rice smuggling. Border control will be beefed up and corrupt officers will face serious disciplinary action.

UMNO and Barisan Nasional have given unnecessary monopoly powers to certain companies. The Pakatan Harapan Government will eliminate this monopoly power.

We will establish a complaint mechanism of in the Agriculture Ministry so that farmers who have been mistreated can have direct access to the government.

Distribution of subsidies will be managed by the appropriate government agency and not by companies with vested interest like BERNAS. The mechanism of payment and the rate of subsidies for paddy prices will be revised to ensure a fairer system.

Government grants will be made in cash to the eligible farmers to enable them to choose their own fertilizers and seeds that are appropriate to their needs.

Pakatan Harapan sees farmers as unsung heroes. They farm their lands to produce high quality crops for the rest of the population. But they have been ignored by UMNO and Barisan Nasional. They are only visited once in a while, especially during elections

The Pakatan Harapan Government will protect and safeguard the welfare of farmers, livestock breeders and fishermen with the introduction of a Takaful scheme.

Some farmers and breeders suffer misfortune when there is bad weather or disease attacks against their livestock and crops. The Pakatan Harapan Government will provide assistance to guarantee the income of farmers, livestock breeders and fishermen when such a disaster struck.

Attention will be given to the rubber tappers who face drastic price reduction for reasons that are beyond their control. Rubber buffer stock will be created to ensure stability in the market.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will eliminate manipulation of middlemen on farmers, livestock breeders and fishermen.
