# Promise 58: Defend and protect the country's borders from external invasion, trafficking and smuggling

The BN government has failed to defend the nationâ€™s land and sea borders. In the peninsular, fishermen in the Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea continue to be threatened by the presence of foreign fishing boats.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will increase resources and capacity of the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency to address these threats and The ASEAN platform will be used to achieve intra-regional solution.

Foreign ships are reportedly seen in Sarawak waters while the people of Sabah continue to worry about repeat of the Lahad Datu tragedy. Perlis has also witnessed Wang Kelian tragedy, where shallow graves of trafficking victims have been discovered. Smuggling activities also remains a widespread problem.

All of these clearly reflect the dismal failure of UMNO and BN to safeguard the sovereignty of the country, which is also partly due to widespread corruption.

The principle of Pakatan Harapan Government is that national borders and sovereignty of Malaysia cannot be compromised. We will double our diplomatic efforts and accelerate bilateral negotiations between Malaysia and Indonesia and the Philippines to resolve extra territorial issues.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will not tolerate lack of integrity of any enforcement agency. In order to ensure the safety of the people and uphold country's sovereignty, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) will focus on protecting the borders of the country and take firm action against any perpetrators irrespective of their position.
