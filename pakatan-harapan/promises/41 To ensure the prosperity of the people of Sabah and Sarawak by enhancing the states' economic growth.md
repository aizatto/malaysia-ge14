# Promise 41: To ensure the prosperity of the people of Sabah and Sarawak by enhancing the states’ economic growth

Sabah and Sarawak are rich in natural resources, such as oil, gas and timber. But the wealth of Sabah and Sarawak has been exploited and plundered by UMNO and Barisan Nasional enrich the peninsula, while the east Malaysian states remain among the poorest in Malaysia. This inequality will cease when Pakatan Harapan comes to power.

Our Government will increase petroleum royalty to Sabah and Sarawak to 20 per cent or equivalent, as a first step in distributing petroleum revenue equitably. This will enable Sabah and Sarawak to take over responsibilities for more development expenditure.

Good infrastructure is key to economic development, but the current government has been too busy using annual development allocation to line up their pockets and their cronies. The Pakatan Harapan Government will put a stop to all this so that the nation’s prosperity is shared by all. Greater allocation of resources will be channelled to:

- Ensure supply of clean water and clean energy to urban and rural areas
- Build roads and highways to connect towns and cities throughout the state, and repair bridges and damaged roads
- Review construction services such as Trans-Borneo railway using a public-private partnership model, and ensuring contracts will be given to locals
- Create targeted aid schemes for the welfare of Sabahans and Sarawakians
- Build more public schools and health centres

The 1974 Petroleum Development Act will be scrutinised to review Petronas’s monopoly on national gas and oil products, especially from Sabah and Sarawak. This is to enable Sabah and Sarawak to set up their own oil and gas companies, and not limiting their role as a contractor to Petronas only.

To ensure that Sabah and Sarawak oil and gas products can be utilised for the long run, entities similar to the National Trust Fund (KWAN) can be set up in Sabah and Sarawak, after studying more sustainable models like in Norway and Alaska.
