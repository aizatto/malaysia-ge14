# Promise 35: Raising the dignity of workers and creating more quality jobs

Malaysians are among the most educated and hardworking people in Asia. However, under the rule of UMNO and the Barisan Nasional (BN), local workers have not been dignified, and even oppressed. It is obvious the current government only favour big corporate companies.

UMNO and Barisan Nasional plan to bring in more than one million foreign workers from Bangladesh, which will only serve to increase the number of foreign workers and negatively impacts the local workers' wages. As a result, salaries are no longer adequate to meet day to day needs of Malaysians.

It is increasingly difficult for those who have finished their education to get quality jobs. Locals are forced to work as temporary workers or contract workers under employers who are unscrupulous. The ruling government prefers them to stay as nasi lemak sellers!

Today, the wages of many young people are pathetic. University graduates for example earn an average salary of around RM2,000, which is the same for those who graduated in 1998.

Pakatan Harapan recognises the challenges faced by of young people and Malaysian labour force.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will strengthen the rights of workers to establish trade unions and to select which union to join at their respective workplaces. Employees must have right to form trade unions, and their freedom to voluntarily join a union will be protected. Additionally, the right to negotiate via collective bargaining will be protected and advanced.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure protection of workers' rights is at par with international standards and which adhere to conventions established by the International Labour Organization (ILO).

Further, the Pakatan Harapan Government will focus on creating 1 million quality jobs to ensure social mobility of our citizens to increase the middle class. We will also boost investments in STEM sector so that Malaysia remains competitive globally.

To ensure increase in the wages of the people, the Pakatan Harapan Government will raise minimum wage to RM1,500, and at the same time introduce policies and regulations so that local workers are prioritised and not side-lined by their employers. The number of foreign workers will be gradually reduced and we will ban our Ministers from issuing support letters to hire foreign workers.

In order to prepare Malaysian workers to face the challenges of Industrial Revolution 4.0, the unemployed will be retrained for free in new sectors, especially in the technology sector.

Recognising that Malaysia is hosting more than 150,000 refugees, including Rohingyas and Syrians, the Pakatan Harapan Government will legitimise their status by providing them with UNHCR cards and ensuring their legal right to work. Their labour rights will be at par with locals and this initiative will reduce the country's need for foreign workers and lower the risk of refugees from becoming involved in criminal activities and underground economies. Providing them with jobs will help refugees to build new lives and without subjecting them to oppression.

To enable parents to continue working, the Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure that child care services are available for all children up to 12 years of age.This service will be subsidised for all government servants. Private companies will be given incentives to provide the same services.

In order for SME companies to safeguard the welfare of their employees, The Pakatan Harapan Government will coordinate the provision of childcare services with employers so that employees from several companies located in the same area can avail those services. The services of social entrepreneurship sector and non-profit organisations will also be enlisted to achieve this goal.

We firmly believe the future of new workers and young people to work is more secure under the Pakatan Harapan Government.
