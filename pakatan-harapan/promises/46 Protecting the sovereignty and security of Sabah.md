# Promise 46: Protecting the sovereignty and security of Sabah

The people of Sabah had to face security risks for a long time as UMNO and Barisan Nasional failed to safeguard the borders.

To date, the people of Sabah are still facing threats related to the presence of foreigners. The practices of the ruling government have led to these illegal immigrants having identity cards to pass off as locals.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to achieve a fair solution to the issue of identity card which have been granted to illegal immigrants, thereby ensuring that voters' lists in Sabah can be cleared.

The Commission's mandate will be determined jointly by the Federal Government and the Government of Sabah, but the Chairman of this Commission will a qualified Sabahan with unquestionable integrity.

The Commission will also be mandated to propose appropriate follow-up actions. The number of security forces guarding the Sabah border will also be boosted.
