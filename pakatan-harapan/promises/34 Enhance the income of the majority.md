# Promise 34: Enhance the income of the majority

There is rising income inequality both in the public sector and the private sector. The number of people who can save is low. Bank Negara Malaysia reports (2015) that three out of every four Malaysians cannot afford even RM1,000 in case of emergency, and only 6 percent can survive for more than six months if they lose their source of income. The failure of UMNO and the Barisan Nasional to help ordinary people is very real. Pakatan Harapan will defend the fate of all Malaysians, irrespective of their race, religion and creed, especially those who need our help. Pakatan Harapanâ€™s key strategy is to boost economic development to create more job opportunities, while at the same time provide a social security network for the lower income group. No one will be left behind.

In order to put end to the persistent discrimination against Sabah and Sarawak, the Pakatan Harapan Government will raise the minimum wage there to be equal to that of the Peninsular. Minimum wage will be raised to RM1,500 per month nationwide in the first term of the Pakatan Harapan Government, and we will review this rate every 2 years. To reduce the burden on employers, the Pakatan Harapan Government will share 50 percent of the due to the raise in minimum wage. This means that when the minimum wage is raised from RM1,000 to RM1,500, the Pakatan Harapan Government will share the cost difference of RM500 with the employer equally. The increase in foreign workers is one of the factors that has kept the wages of local labour low. It is evident UMNO and Barisan Nasional have failed miserably to control the number of foreign workers in the country.

Thus, Pakatan Harapan Government promises to reduce the number of foreign workers from 6 million to 4 million in the first term of our administration.

Incentive packages for small and medium sized companies will be increased as well as for those living in villages and in FELDA schemes throughout the country.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will also assist the Islamic Religious Councils and the Islamic Religious Departments to channel the aid of zakat and charity to the less fortunate more effectively, efficiently and quickly. Information on household income and the needs of the poorest will be shared with the state government and local authorities, without overriding the state's power and jurisdiction over religious affairs.

A special agency will be established to take over BR1M management and introduce a structured cash transfer scheme. This scheme will be free from the influence or interference of political parties and politicians.

The agency will take immediate action to study the welfare benefits mechanism in developed countries and introduce appropriate schemes using local resources and Malaysia's capabilities, as well as encourage the private sector and charitable organisations to contribute.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will also enhance the involvement of welfare charities and social enterprises to assist those in need. Assistance will be provided to approved bodies.
