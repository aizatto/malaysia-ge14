# Promise 30: Support the economic growth of Bumiputera and all citizens in the country.

Pakatan Harapan will ensure a healthier economic growth so that the Bumiputera and all citizens in this country can enjoy equitable share of the nationâ€™s wealth. We will maintain Malaysia as a country that is economically open, able to attract foreign investments, and strong enough, such that our companies can invest abroad.

Domestically, our main focus will be to develop the SMEs. The SME sector provides employment to more than 65 per cent of Malaysians. Our vision is for the SMEs to be competitive in ASEAN and they can play an active role in the global value chain, as well as contribute towards the Industrial Revolution 4.0.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will give continuous support to qualified SMEs run by Bumiputera and all citizens. Those who are able to expand to other countries will be given assistance in capital and technology for them to do so. The welfare of SME operators will always be guaranteed in all international trade agreements, and we will not just look after the interests of large companies and cronies the way UMNO and Barisan Nasional operates today.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will give particular attention to the economic development of the Malays and Bumiputera, so that they will become a group that can stand tall when competing globally.

To guarantee continuous support for Bumiputera entrepreneurs, the Pakatan Harapan Government will produce a comprehensive annual report on the total Bumiputera equity holding so that it become a benchmark when we discuss the topic. This report will be presented of Malay and Bumiputera equity holding so that it becomes the right benchmark in order to achieve increased equity in the market. This report will be tabled in Parliament in every budget speech.

The Pakatan Harapan Government also will elevate the status of non- governmental organizations working on Malay and Bumiputera socio- economic such as the Majlis Perundingan Melayu and other bodies, making them as the Government's official dialogue partners.

Through this holistic socio-economic reform, the Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure we achieve our Vision 2020, to make Malaysia a united nation, with a confident Malaysian society, infused by strong moral and ethical values, living in a society that is democratic, liberal and tolerant, caring, economically just and equitable, progressive and prosperous, and in full possession of an economy that is competitive, dynamic, robust and resilient.
