# PILLAR 3: SPUR SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH

Malaysia once enjoyed economic growth of up to 8-9 per cent a year but now the growth rate is lower. Even worse, the inequality gap is getting worse, with the rich growing richer but ordinary people facing more difficulties. Those in the top 20 percent can live in comfort, but, workers and the common people as well as those who are in the B40 cluster are left out.

The country is growing but only a small group is enjoying the benefits. The country's top leaders live a lavish lifestyle, far from the daily challenges that ordinary folks have to experience.

This situation needs to be corrected. Outrageous inequality can lead to a dysfunctional society and can produce a negative impact on national harmony. National development must occur in a sustainable way so that we can pass to our future generations a well-kept environment.

Pakatan Harapan will reform the country’s economic structure so that confidence and credibility will return, and the people as a whole can reap the benefits of development. The best way to stimulate the economy is to return the people's money into their own pockets, not take the money to put into the pockets of cronies and the already-rich. Once the money is returned to the people, they will spend the money according to their own needs, thereby contributing significantly to domestic economic growth, create new job opportunities and attract more investments. This is the form of economic growth which will really benefit the most people.

Pakatan Harapan believes that the people’s socioeconomic status need to be uplifted and the country's wealth must be shared in a fair and equitable manner. Reducing inequality is of utmost importance. This will ensure the population can enjoy quality education, good skills training, good jobs and good housing.

The Pakatan Harapan Government will ensure the economy is driven by innovation, and we will introduce policies that will encourage entrepreneurs to succeed, especially small and medium-sized enterprises as they are the backbone of our national economy. Policies geared towards competitive open economy, encourage investment and productivity are the foundation of our administration. We expect suppliers and producers to compete in ensuring the lowest prices for the highest quality of products and services.
