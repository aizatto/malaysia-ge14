# PILLAR 5: CREATE A MALAYSIA THAT IS INCLUSIVE, MODERATE AND RESPECTED GLOBALLY

Citizens of any country aspire for an inclusive, harmonious, progressive, prosperous, just and equitable life, free from any forms of discrimination. The diversity of races and religions should be seen as a source of power, not as an obstacle. However, UMNO and Barisan Nasional have for long played the racial and religious card, pitting one race with the other for the sake of short-term political expediency and gains.

On the other hand, the BNâ€™s administration was based on a political model called 'consociationalism' which the political elites believed represented all the races in the country. In reality, it practised racial politics that is premised on dividing society racial lines to ensure the political elite is in power. When racial politics is coupled with religious politics, it will negatively impact on national harmony.

Therefore, the Pakatan Harapan Government will implement policies and programmes that unite the nation and create an inclusive society and maintain the harmony of multi-racial and multi religious Malaysia. We are confident that this will enable Malaysia to become a global model of inter- racial and inter religious harmony.
